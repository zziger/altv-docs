What are config files used for Config files are the files that give alt:V information about your server configuration. In a config file you specify e.g. your server name, the amount of slots, the type of your resource etc. There are several different config files in alt:V, which all have their own set of configuration options, usage and location. Important rules about the config files Every line only contains one configuration option Every configuration option is a key value pair, so it starts with the key , then a : to seperate the key and the value, and after that the value Lines are ended with a linebreak, commas at the end of every line are optional Strings don't need to be inclosed in \" or ' , only when they contain special characters like , for example Lines that start with a hashtag ( # ) are ignored and can be used for comments Empty lines are ignored For advanced users If you want to see for yourself how the config files get parsed or even want to use the config files that alt:V uses yourself, you can take a look at the GitHub repository for it. The config solution alt:V uses is a single C/C++ header file, so you should keep in mind that you probably need some experience in the C programming language if you want to take a look at the source code of it yourself.",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc How to Contribute This document includes a set of guidelines for contributing to alt:V documentation. Documentation structure Structure consists of one or more repositories linked to the core repository (you're currently in it). Core repository is responsible for including linked repositories in documentation generation process. We're using DocFx generator for that task. Each linked repository have directory structure that looks similar to this: └───docs │ build.cmd │ build.ps1 │ docfx.json │ index.md │ toc.yml │ ├───api └───articles docfx.json is the main configuration file, used locally for testing purposes. If you wish to learn more about its format, refer to this . build.cmd and build.ps1 are scripts written in PowerShell to test documentation locally before publishing changes to core repository. Later we'll explain how they work and how to use them. index.md and toc.yml are main Conceptual documents that are required (with some exceptions) in documentation. toc.yml file (Table of Contents or ToC) is YAML document that specifies documentation structure in current directory and is responsible for linking other subdirectories for ease of navigation. If you wish to learn more about its format, refer to this article . index.md file is Markdown document that appear in every directory and serves as a starting page. api contains API documentation, which is mostly generated automatically from source code of the project and later incorporated by documentation generator. When generated automatically, we don't edit these files directly, but we use files called overwrite documents, which allows us to overwrite files without editing source at all. articles contains Conceptual documentation, which will be the place where you'll spend the most of your time. In the opposition to api folder, files there are created manually by contributors. Linked repositories We include community created modules in our documentation and if you want to contribute to language specific documentation, switch to repository posted below: Language Repository JS https://github.com/altmp/altv-types C# https://github.com/FabianTerhorst/coreclr-module Build tools As mentioned previously, every linked repository should contain build tools to easily test and verify your work. As of now, we're only providing ways to do that on Windows, where PowerShell is installed. Warning Other operating systems are not supported by us and by current documentation generator (although it might change in DocFx v3). Actual code is defined in build.ps1 , where build.cmd serves as wrapper (by default in Windows Explorer it's not allowed to execute PowerShell scripts by simply opening them). Command-line arguments: Argument Description Usage port Changes port used by DocFx to host website on. ./build.ps1 -port 80 cleanMetadata All generated output will be removed on each run. ./build.ps1 -cleanMetadata cleanOnly All dependencies will be removed only. ./build.ps1 -cleanOnly Initial setup To start adventure with contribution, you need programs installed such as Git, Node with npm package manager and if you wish to work with C# documentation, Visual Studio with \".NET desktop development\" workload or Visual Studio Build Tools with \".NET Desktop build tools\" workload. Fork the repository - https://github.com/altmp/altv-docs/fork Open a terminal on Windows. Move to the directory that you want to work in. Clone your repository, replace USER with your GitHub username: git clone https://github.com/USER/altv-docs Add the altmp/altv-docs repo as a remote repository git remote add upstream https://github.com/altmp/altv-docs Switch to the docs directory if there's one in your forked repository. It should have files as described in documentation structure. Generating and testing When build.ps1 script is executed, first we download dependencies such as DocFx tool, plugins, templates or linked repositories etc. Warning Keep in mind that currently we don't automatically update dependencies, but manually deleting them should trigger redownload. Next thing is project metadata generation, which is needed for API documentation. Lastly, DocFx build is executed and generated site will be available on localhost:8080 by default. To stop running script or update website with newest changes, simply terminate running script by pressing key combination Ctrl+C . After that, you can execute script again if needed. If everything works to this moment, you can now start contributing. Tip It's highly recommended that you should work on separate branch rather than master , so you can easily incorporate changes when repository gets updated. Creating articles Before you start creating/editing files, you should think about what you want to add first. Warning You can't write articles about GTA:V stuff, like modding, data etc. That stuff belongs to our wiki website. Title should be as short as possible, understandable and preferably catchy. Another thing to do is to choose proper category for your article. You should find available ones in articles/ directory, they look like folders. Now, if you plan on making only single article, you can go to step Single article . If not, you've to create category for them in case you haven't found one. Follow instructions defined in step Article series . Article series Just like before, you've to think of the name for your category and it also should be as short as possible, understandable and preferably catchy (also it can't be the same as article name). When you got one, create new folder with that name in articles/ directory. Tip Remember, name should be lowercase, alphanumeric and spaces should be replaced with hyphen. You can go inside that folder and create two files there named index.md and toc.yml . These files are required, though index.md can stay empty for now. Before we'll focus on making actual articles, we've to make your category visible in Table of Contents. Let's open articles/toc.yml file, which now looks similar to this: - name: Getting Started href: getting-started/ topicHref: getting-started/index.md - name: How to Contribute href: contributing.md We'll copy Getting Started item and append it just below with changed details. Caution Make sure that How to Contribute item is always at the bottom. Before: - name: Getting Started href: getting-started/ topicHref: getting-started/index.md - name: How to Contribute href: contributing.md After: - name: Getting Started href: getting-started/ topicHref: getting-started/index.md - name: Fancy Category href: fancy-category/ topicHref: fancy-category/index.md - name: How to Contribute href: contributing.md If you've done everything correctly to this point, your category should now be visible. Let's go back to our index.md file created earlier. Index file in our category should contain short summary and what articles are featured. Now we can move on to next step below. Single article Now you can create file in articles/ directory (or in your category directory) with title as filename and .md extension. Tip Remember, filename should be lowercase, alphanumeric and spaces should be replaced with hyphen. Now that file will be included in generation process, but it's not visible in Table of Contents (also abbreviated as ToC) yet. To happen so, we need to add new entry in toc.yml file in the same directory, so your file will be fully visible. Before: - name: Getting Started href: getting-started/ topicHref: getting-started/index.md - name: How to Contribute href: contributing.md After: - name: Getting Started href: getting-started/ topicHref: getting-started/index.md - name: Fancy Article href: fancy-article.md - name: How to Contribute href: contributing.md In case you're creating article series , your toc.yml file is more likely empty at the moment. You don't need to copy code above, you'll only need to add new item. Now we can switch to our file content and first text which will be title formatted as Heading 1 . Example: # Contribution ... content here ... If you encounter trouble with Markdown, you can refresh your memory here . Publishing your work Once you have finished working on your changes, you can submit a pull request to have your changes merged into the repository and included in the documentation. Before submitting a pull request, make sure that you've verified your work. If you've doubts or need help with something, feel free to ask in alt:V Discord server #scripting-offtopic .",

It will explain the concept of logging, the different types of logging and how to use logging in alt:V. What is logging used for As a programmer, logging is very important for debugging and showing information. By logging to the console, you can check the values of variables etc. at runtime to find your bug or optimize your code. Important things to know about logging Don't use logging in production too much, because it can lag the console and will also hide the important logs you have placed. It is best to completely disable logging on the client in the production, and setting logging to the bare minimum (e.g. only errors) on the server. Also don't put any sensitive information into your logs, the logs get saved to a file in plain text, so logging e.g. a password to the console is a big security risk. When and how to use logging There are different types of logging, which should be used for different kinds of logs. You can see a table of the different types of logs here: Type Usage Infos To display general information about something Warnings To display something maybe being wrong, but not being very important Errors To display something going very wrong, which needs immediate action Using colors in logs If you want to make your log messages look better, you can use different color codes to highlight important parts of the message. Or to group/categorize your logs better. The color codes can be used by appending a color code, like this for example: ~r~ , before your part of the text that should have that color. You can see a list of all color codes in the table below: Color code Screenshot ~k~ ~r~ ~g~ ~b~ ~y~ ~m~ ~c~ ~w~ ~lk~ ~lr~ ~lg~ ~lb~ ~ly~ ~lm~ ~lc~ ~lw~ Using logs in your code Here you can find small examples in the different programming languages alt:V offers on how to use logging: JavaScript alt.log(\"~r~Hello ~g~World!\"); alt.logWarning(\"This is a warning\"); alt.logError(\"This is an error\"); C# ColoredMessage coloredMessage = new ColoredMessage(); coloredMessage += TextColor.Red; coloredMessage += \"Hello \"; coloredMessage += TextColor.Green; coloredMessage += \"World!\"; Alt.LogColored(coloredMessage); Alt.LogWarning(\"This is a warning\"); Alt.LogError(\"This is an error\"); Alt.LogInfo(\"This is an info\"); Alt.LogDebug(\"This is a debug message\");",

CompilationDiagnostic Diagnostic events for diagnosing compilation and pre-compilation features. Contention Log when lock contention occurs. (Monitor.Enters actually blocks) Debugger .NET Debugger events Default Recommend default flags (good compromise on verbosity). Exception Log exception processing. GC Logging when garbage collections and finalization happen. GCAllObjectAllocation Turns on capturing the stack and type of object allocation made by the .NET Runtime. This is only supported after V4.5.3 (Late 2014) This can be very verbose and you should seriously using GCSampledObjectAllocationHigh instead (and GCSampledObjectAllocationLow for production scenarios). GCHandle Events when GC handles are set or destroyed. GCHeapAndTypeNames Indicates that you want type names looked up and put into the events (not just meta-data tokens). GCHeapCollect Triggers a GC. Can pass a 64 bit value that will be logged with the GC Start event so you know which GC you actually triggered. GCHeapDump Enables the events associated with dumping the GC heap GCHeapSnapshot This provides the flags commonly needed to take a heap .NET Heap snapshot with ETW. GCHeapSurvivalAndMovement Enables events associate with object movement or survival with each GC. GCSampledObjectAllocationHigh Enables allocation sampling with the 'fast'. Sample to limit to 100 allocations per second per type. This is good for most detailed performance investigations. Note that this DOES update the allocation path to be slower and only works if the process start with this on. GCSampledObjectAllocationLow Enables allocation sampling with the 'slow' rate, Sample to limit to 5 allocations per second per type. This is reasonable for monitoring. Note that this DOES update the allocation path to be slower and only works if the process start with this on. Interop Log information about code thunks that transition between managed and unmanaged code. Jit Logging when Just in time (JIT) compilation occurs. JITSymbols What is needed to get symbols for JIT compiled code. JittedMethodILToNativeMap Dump the native to IL mapping of any method that is JIT compiled. (V4.5 runtimes and above). JitTracing Logging of the internal workings of the Just In Time compiler. This is fairly verbose. It details decisions about interesting optimization (like inlining and tail call) Loader Logging when modules actually get loaded and unloaded. Monitoring Events intended for monitoring on an ongoing basis. NGen Logging when precompiled native (NGEN) images are loaded. None OverrideAndSuppressNGenEvents If enabled will suppress the rundown of NGEN events on V4.0 runtime (has no effect on Pre-V4.0 runtimes). PerfTrack TODO document Security Events associated with validating security restrictions. Stack Also log the stack trace of events for which this is valuable. StartEnumeration Indicates that on attach or module load , a rundown of all existing methods should be done StopEnumeration Indicates that on detach or process shutdown, a rundown of all existing methods should be done SupressNGen This suppresses NGEN events on V4.0 (where you have NGEN PDBs), but not on V2.0 (which does not know about this bit and also does not have NGEN PDBS). Threading Log events associated with the threadpool, and other threading events. ThreadTransfer This allows tracing work item transfer events (thread pool enqueue/dequeue/ioenqueue/iodequeue/a.o.) Type Enables the 'BulkType' event",

    "title": "Async Module",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Async Module This article will talk about how to use altv's thread safe. All techniques described in this article will only work when you extend AsyncResource. Setup async module First download the nuget package to access the async api's. https://www.nuget.org/packages/AltV.Net.Async Next you need to inherit from AsyncResource instead of Resource . Now you can use the async module. Async event handlers You can register a async event handler when using AltAsync instead of Alt for registering event handlers like AltAsync.OnPlayerConnect += async (player, reason) => { Console.WriteLine($\"{player.Name} connected.\"); await DoAsyncStuff(player); }; Use apis thread safe All api's related to entities like Player, Vehicle, Blip, ColShape, Checkpoint, VoiceChannel are not thread safe and will make your server crash when used wrong in async code. How to use most apis thread safe without performance loose? You can get the position of a player in async code by preventing the player entity to get deleted while accessing the position. This doesn't work with all apis Small example: Position position; lock (player) { if (player.Exists) { position = player.Position } } Console.WriteLine(\"X:\" + position.X); Lets breakdown the small code snippet. Position position; We create a value to save the position into; lock (player) We lock the player to prevent access to it from multiple c# threads at the same time. This also prevents the c# module to delete the player on disconnect. Otherwise the server would end up crashing by accessing the player position of a deleted entity. Note: locking the player when its already locked will end up in a deadlock. Never do this E.g. lock (player) { lock (player) { } } Locks also work accross method calls so be careful. if (player.Exists) { This if check is optional, because not checking it won't crash the server, but will throw a exception when the player doesn't exist anymore. position = player.Position Here we assign the position to the value we declared above. This is essential because no heavy calculations should happen inside a lock statement and the assign makes it possible to use the player position outside the lock statement for e.g. distance calculatione. How to use all apis thread safe A few apis aren't possible to use thread safe from a different thread. To use those apis we have to execute them on main thread. To make this easy for serverdev AltAsync has a method to do just this. Here is a example. var vehicle = await AltAsync.Do(() => Alt.CreateVehicle(VehicleModel.T20, player.Position, player.Rotation)); This example only works when called inside a method that is declared async. AltAsync.Do will execute any code inside of it on the main thread. And will return the result when its awaited. You can also use AltAsync.Do when you don't care about the result and about the execution order. When you need to call multiple apis at once don't do multiple AltAsync.Do when possible. Otherwise it may create a overhead on the main thread. var vehicle = await AltAsync.Do(() => { var vehicle = Alt.CreateVehicle(VehicleModel.T20, player.Position, player.Rotation); var vehicle2 = Alt.CreateVehicle(VehicleModel.Chimera, player.Position, player.Rotation); }); Threadsafe methods from AltV.Net.Alt Entity pools The AltV.Net.Async.AltAsync class does not provide methods to interact with entity pools/lists. If you are using an AsyncResource , the methods for entity pooling on AltV.Net.Alt are overwritten and are threadsafe to use. This includes the following methods: public override IBaseEntityPool GetBaseEntityPool(IEntityPool<IPlayer> playerPool, IEntityPool<IVehicle> vehiclePool); public override IBaseObjectPool<IBlip> GetBlipPool(IBaseObjectFactory<IBlip> blipFactory); public override IBaseObjectPool<ICheckpoint> GetCheckpointPool(IBaseObjectFactory<ICheckpoint> checkpointFactory); public override IBaseObjectPool<IColShape> GetColShapePool(IBaseObjectFactory<IColShape> colShapeFactory); public override IEntityPool<IPlayer> GetPlayerPool(IEntityFactory<IPlayer> playerFactory); public override IEntityPool<IVehicle> GetVehiclePool(IEntityFactory<IVehicle> vehicleFactory); public override IBaseObjectPool<IVoiceChannel> GetVoiceChannelPool(IBaseObjectFactory<IVoiceChannel> voiceChannelFactory); as they are overwritten in the AsyncResource class.",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Introduction Checkpoints are very similiar to Colshapes. The main difference is that Checkpoints are displayed on clients (e.g. as arrow), while colshapes are invisible and designed for detecting collisions. Important to know is that the internal streaming of checkpoints is not optimized and you should use them as less as possible. With checkpoints you are able to detect appearing or disappearing entities of an area, specified by position, radius and height. The specified checkpoint type defines the shape of the checkpoint (there are 3 shapes available: Cylinder, Rings, Arrows). Typical usages of checkpoints are parkour racings or driving/flying tutorials. alt:V offers full API support for creating Checkpoints on serverside. API Methods Method Description Alt.CreateCheckpoint Creates a new checkpoint Alt.ForEachCheckpoint Iterates through all created checkpoints Alt.GetAllCheckpoints Returns all created checkpoints as ICollection<ICheckpoint> Alt.GetCheckpointsArray Returns all created checkpoints as KeyValuePair<IntPtr,ICheckpoint>[] Alt.RemoveCheckpoint Destroys the specified checkpoint Events Alt.OnCheckpoint is raised whenever any checkpoint is entered by any player. Inside of the event handler you need to check which one of your checkpoints got triggered by comparing the object instances with the first parameter. The entity which raised the event is specified by the second parameter. At last state defines if the entity entered ( true ) or left ( false ) the checkpoint area. Full example using AltV.Net; using AltV.Net.Elements.Entities; using System.Drawing; public class CheckpointTest : IScript { private ICheckpoint _demoCheckpoint; public CheckpointTest() { // register event handler Alt.OnCheckpoint += Alt_OnCheckpoint; // create a new checkpoint _demoCheckpoint = Alt.CreateCheckpoint(CheckpointType.Cyclinder, new Position(), 1.5f, 2f, Color.Yellow); } private void Alt_OnCheckpoint(ICheckpoint checkpoint, IEntity entity, bool state) { if (checkpoint != _demoCheckpoint) { return; } if (state) { // entity entered the checkpoint } else { // entity left the checkpoint } } }",

Everything that is possible with custom events can also be created via Alt.OnPlayerEvent . Custom events are registered via Alt.On(eventName, delegate) . The delegate can have any signature and the module checks when a event occurs if the signature of the delegate fits the event arguments the client sends. For custom events you can't use the lambda operator because it needs to know the parameter types. Here is a very basic sample that expects just a single string from a client event named myMessage . We register it via Alt.On . We need to help the compiler a bit by defining the method parameter types for the generic method. The types are defined from left ro right same as in the method definition itself. Alt.On<IPlayer, string>(\"myMessage\", MyMessageHandler); And the method is defined as this. public void MyMessageHandler(IPlayer player, string message) { } The method will be called like this from client alt.emitServer(\"myMessage\", \"my test message\"). The method name doesn't really matter in this case and i just named it similar to the event name. Supported parameter types are object , bool , int , long , uint , ulong , float , double , string , IPlayer (or any types extending IPlayer), IVehicle (or any types extending IVehicle), Dictionary<string, (any type listed here) , Alt.Function , any type listed here as array e.g. int[].

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Entity data Within the C# API, one has different methods to modify data stored on an entity. There are, however, four different data access level that can be used. Data access level The data access level is only accessible within the resource that attached the data. Example For example: Given that the used variable player is the same across different serverside resources, one has this behaviour of the data: // Resource A AltV.Net.Entities.IPlayer player; player.SetData(\"test\", 123); if (player.GetData<int>(\"test\", out var value)) { // value contains 123 } // Resource B AltV.Net.Entities.IPlayer player; if (player.GetData<int>(\"test\", out var value)) { // this scope will not be executed at all / value contains nothing/is the default datatype T (int here) } MetaData access level The meta data access level is accessible by all serverside resources. Example Given are the same conditions as above. // Resource A AltV.Net.Entities.IPlayer player; player.SetMetaData(\"test\", 123); if (player.GetMetaData<int>(\"test\", out var value)) { // value contains 123 } // Resource B AltV.Net.Entities.IPlayer player; if (player.GetMetaData<int>(\"test\", out var value)) { // value contains 123 } Server- and clientside data StreamSyncedMetaData access level The stream synced meta data access level is accessible by all serverside resources and all clients within their streaming range. SyncedMetaData access level Synced meta data can be accessed by the client and server everytime - meaning across all resources and clients without streaming range limitation. Remarks Obviously, the given access levels above are used to reduce network traffic in the one way and to limit the access from other resources. Before you use one of those 4 data access levels, think about what you will need as it might drastically improve your performance. For example, data of a player that is unused by a client, because the target player is out of the streaming range, can be improved by using StreamSyncedData data.",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Entity factories Entity factories allows you to optimize your server performance by defining the data you need to store in a player or vehicle on compile time. This allows much faster data access than via .SetData, .GetData . Step 1, Create the class Defining your custom player or vehicle class by extending Player or Vehicle . You need to implement the default constructor of Player or Vehicle as well. public class MyPlayer : Player { public bool LoggedIn { get; set; } public MyPlayer(IServer server, IntPtr nativePointer, ushort id) : base(server, nativePointer, id) { LoggedIn = false; } } You can't create a player via a constructor, because the player class will be created automatically when someone connects. Thats why you need to create a factory that will create the player for you when its needed. Step 2, Create the factory In the factory the defined default constructor of the player or vehicle class will be called. You only need to override the IPlayer Create(IntPtr playerPointer, ushort id) method and initialize your own class instead of the default one. public class MyPlayerFactory : IEntityFactory<IPlayer> { public IPlayer Create(IServer server, IntPtr playerPointer, ushort id) { return new MyPlayer(server, playerPointer, id); } } Step 3, Apply the factory Now you need to tell the module that it should use your own entity factory for the player. You simply do this by overriding IEntityFactory<IPlayer> GetPlayerFactory() method in your Resource class. This will look like the code below. public class SampleResource : Resource { public override IEntityFactory<IPlayer> GetPlayerFactory() { return new MyPlayerFactory(); } } This also works when you extend AsyncResource ect. Vehicle class It works the same for vehicles, but with a small difference, because you can create vehicles via the constructor by defining the vehicle model, position and rotation. Thats why you most likely will add a second constructor to the vehicle that looks like this. public class MyVehicle : Vehicle { public int MyData { get; set; } // This constructor is used for creation via constructor public MyVehicle(IServer server, uint model, Position position, Rotation rotation) : base(server, model, position, rotation) { MyData = 7; } // This constructor is used for creation via entity factory public MyVehicle(IServer server, IntPtr nativePointer, ushort id) : base(server, nativePointer, id) { MyData = 6; } } Use the custom Entity class For events inside IScript class you can just use your own class instead of IPlayer/IVehicle ect. public class SampleScript: IScript { [ScriptEvent(ScriptEventType.PlayerConnect)] public void MyPlayerConnect(MyPlayer player, string reason) { //... } } For events registered via Alt you can just cast the entities to the custom classes.

    "title": "Entity Sync",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Entity Sync This article will describes how to use the entity sync package to sync custom entities from serverside to clients efficiently. Setup Install the following nuget packages and make sure both packages are on the latest version: https://www.nuget.org/packages/AltV.Net.EntitySync // The core package with the sync logic https://www.nuget.org/packages/AltV.Net.EntitySync.ServerEvent // A optional package that will send the entity sync events to the client via server events Configure the Entity Sync AltEntitySync.Init(1, (threadId) => 100, (threadId) => false, (threadCount, repository) => new ServerEventNetworkLayer(threadCount, repository), (entity, threadCount) => (entity.Id % threadCount), (entityId, entityType, threadCount) => (entityId % threadCount), (threadId) => new LimitedGrid3(50_000, 50_000, 100, 10_000, 10_000, 300), new IdProvider()); Now breakdown the parameters of the Init function: The first parameter is the thread count, this describes the number of thats that will run in parallel to calculate the streamed entities. The second parameter is the sync rate, it describes the interval in which each sync thread calculates the streamed entities and can be configured per thread id. The third parameter is a bool with that you can enable net owner calculations and events. The fourth parameter is the Action that returns a new NetworkLayer for a repository. The ServerEventNetworkLayer is part of the second nuget package. The fifth parameter defines the thread the entity shoud use. The sixth parameter defines the thread a entityId + entityType should use. The seventh parameter is the Action that returns a new space partitioning algorithm for each specific sync thread id. The LimitedGrid3 is one of the algorithms that comes included in the core. LimitedGrid3 has following parameters: (int maxX, int maxY, int areaSize, int xOffset, int yOffset, int limit). The (int maxX, int maxY) parameters are defining the size of the map the grid is inserting, removing and finding entities in. The default values are defining the default gta 5 map. The two offsets (int xOffset, int yOffset) preventing the corrdinates to become negative, because the gta maps goes from -10k to 50k. The (int limit) makes sure a client can only have streamed in the amount of entities he can actually render. E.g. the gta 5 client in altv can only create around 300 Objects without stability issues. The eight and last parameter is the id provider that increments the entity ids incremental and free's unused ids. The IdProvider is included inside the core package as well. Add Entities To add entities that can be streamed there are two ways. The easiert way is to use the CreateEntity method from AltEntitySync. AltEntitySync.CreateEntity(ulong type, Vector3 position, int dimension, uint range, IDictionary<string, object> data); The entity type are your own ids to differentiate between e.g. a object, a ped, a 3d Text, ect. The position is the entity position. The dimension is working same as the dimension of a player, vehicle ect. The range defines the streaming range this entity is streamed in. The data is the data the entity contains when its streamed in on clientside. The second way is to use the entity constructor. var entity = new Entity(ulong type, Vector3 position, int dimension, uint range, IDictionary<string, object> data); AltEntitySync.AddEntity(entity); Remove entities To remove a entity you just need the entity or the entity id. AltEntitySync.RemoveEntity(IEntity entity); // or AltEntitySync.RemoveEntity(ulong id); Update entity position The update the position of a entity just use the position setter. The position is a Vector3. entity.Position = new Vector3(x, y, z); Update entity range The update the range of a entity just use the range setter. The range is a uint and should never be 0. entity.Range = range; Update entity dimension The update the dimension of a entity just use the dimension setter. The dimension is a int. entity.Dimension = dimension; Update entity data The update the range of a entity just use the data methods. Each type that works with Custom Events also works with ServerEventNetworkLayer. entity.SetData(\"my-data\", 123); You can reset the data with. Resetted data is received as null. entity.ResetData(\"my-data\"); Get entity data if (entity.TryGetData(\"my-data\", out int data)) { } Get entity net owner This is always null when third parameter is false, otherwise its the closest player to the entity. entity.NetOwner ServerEventNetworkLayer This describes the events the client receives from the ServerEventNetworkLayer that you need to implement in your client code. Entity create This is called every time you come in the range of the entity. The server assumes you cache the entity depending on the entity.id so make sure to do it. alt.onServer(\"entitySync:create\", (entityId, entityType, position, newEntityData) => { alt.log(entityId); alt.log(entityType); alt.log(position); alt.log(newEntityData); if (newEntityData) { if (!entityData[entityType]) { entityData[entityType] = {}; } if (!entityData[entityType][entityId]) { entityData[entityType][entityId] = {}; } for (const key in newEntityData) { entityData[entityType][entityId][key] = newEntityData[key]; } } let currentEntityData; if (entityData[entityType] && entityData[entityType][entityId]) { currentEntityData = entityData[entityType][entityId]; } else { currentEntityData = null; } alt.log(currentEntityData); }) Entity remove This is called every time you go out of the range of the entity. alt.onServer(\"entitySync:remove\", (entityId, entityType) => { let currentEntityData; if (entityData[entityType]) { currentEntityData = entityData[entityType][entityId]; } else { currentEntityData = null; } alt.log(entityId); alt.log(entityType); alt.log(entityData); }) Entity position update This is called very time you update the entity position while you are in the range of the entity. alt.onServer(\"entitySync:updatePosition\", (entityId, entityType, position) => { let currEntityData; if (entityData[entityType]) { currEntityData = entityData[entityType][entityId]; } else { currEntityData = null; } alt.log(entityId); alt.log(entityType); alt.log(currEntityData); }) Entity data update This is called every time you update the entity data while you are in the range of the entity. alt.onServer(\"entitySync:updateData\", (entityId, entityType, newEntityData) => { if (!entityData[entityType]) { entityData[entityType] = {}; } if (!entityData[entityType][entityId]) { entityData[entityType][entityId] = {}; } if (newEntityData) { for (const key in newEntityData) { entityData[entityType][entityId][key] = newEntityData[key]; } } let currentEntityData = entityData[entityType][entityId]; }) Entity clear cache This is called every time you remove a entity on serverside completely and clients still have data in cache of this entity. alt.onServer(\"entitySync:clearCache\", (entityId, entityType) => { if (!entityData[entityType]) { return; } delete entityData[entityType][entityId]; }) Entity net owner This is called when you set the third parameter to true and the current client becomes the net owner of the entity by beeing the closest player to the entity. alt.onServer(\"entitySync:netOwner\", (entityId, entityType, isNetOwner) => { //... }) Now you can call your own logic inside the events to spawn objects, npcs, 3d text, markers, ... ect.",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Interactions This article will describe how to add fast serverside player interactions. You can also use the interactions for something else then player interactions, but player interactions are the common usecase for them. Setup Interactions First download the nuget package to access the interaction api's: https://www.nuget.org/packages/AltV.Net.interactions Next you need to init the interactions package. The best place to do this is when your resource is starting. Note: It doesn't matter if your resource is a async resource. The code below is just for illustrating how to do it in general. public class MyResource: Resource { public override void OnStart() { // (some code from you) AltInteractions.Init(); // (some code from you) } public override void OnStop() { // (some code from you) AltInteractions.Dispose(); // (some code from you) } } Now the interaction package setup is done and ready to be used. Create interactions To create a interaction you need to create a instance of it first. This is how the default constructor looks like. var interaction = new Interaction(ulong type, ulong id, Vector3 position, int dimension, uint range); The first parameter is the type. This defines the interaction type. A type can be anything you want to use it for. A example might be: type 1 = house, type 2 = car shop, ect. The second parameter is the id. This defines the interaction id for the given type. Only the id + type in combination needs to be unique. You can have the same id used in different types. This is useful when you already have ids for houses and car shops and both have own auto incrementing counters starting at 1. The third parameter is the position. This defines the position this interaction is present. The fourth parameter is the dimension. This defines the dimension this interaction is visible inside. The dimension logic is the same as for players, vehicle ect. X can see only X -X can see 0 and -X 0 can't see -X and X And the fifth and last parameter is the range. This defines the range this interaction is usable in. Add Interactions To add a interaction to the system you can just call: AltInteractions.AddInteraction(interaction); Remove Interactions To remove a interaction from the system you can just call: AltInteractions.RemoveInteraction(interaction); Find Interactions To find all interactions that are on a specific position and visible for a specific dimensions you can call: var interactions = await AltInteractions.FindInteractions(position, dimension); As you can see on the code this method returns a task that needs to be awaited. Now we have a list of all interactions that are visible at this specific dimension and are in range of the positions. The returned object is null when no interactions are found. foreach (var interaction in interactions) { // do stuff with interaction.Id and interaction.Type } Create custom interactions You might want to add custom interactions to add custom data to them. One example would be to add your house object to the interaction. You have to add the default constructor when inherit from Interaction public class HouseInteraction: Interaction { public HouseEntity House { get; } public HouseInteraction( HouseEntity house, ulong type, ulong id, Vector3 position, int dimension, uint range) : base(type, id, position, dimension, range) { House = house; } } Lets see how our interactions loop from above now looks like: foreach (var interaction in interactions) { if (interaction is HouseInteraction houseInteraction) { // do something with houseInteraction.House } } We can now get the house object from the interaction instead of using the interaction id and type to fetch it. Note: You still should use the correct id and type to add and remove the interactions correctly. Trigger interactions With custom classes you can make use of another feature that is available. The Interaction class has a abstract method you can override. public class HouseInteraction: Interaction { public HouseEntity House { get; } public HouseInteraction( HouseEntity house, ulong type, ulong id, Vector3 position, int dimension, uint range) : base(type, id, position, dimension, range) { House = house; } public override bool OnInteraction(IPlayer player, Vector3 interactionPosition, int interactionDimension) { // do something with the House obj return false; } } This method is getting triggered each time you call: AltInteractions.TriggerInteractions(player); When you returns false from a interaction you allow other interactions that might be in range as well to also call OnInteraction. When you return true, no other interaction will trigger. The OnInteraction method is triggered inside a async context. It should be none blocking to not block other interactions since they run in the same task. When you need to use await inside it start a new task with Task.Run. Make sure to use the altv.net apis inside the async context correctly.",

    "title": "Internal information",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Internal information This section provides a high-level overview about the internal structure of the C# module and how it's playing together with the AltV server. Important Resource developers don't need to know the internal structure, but it is helpful sometimes. This is mainly for developers who like to contribute to the C# module. Initialization of csharp-module When the altv-server is starting it checks modules part of the server.cfg configuration file. When there's the csharp-module specified, the server loads the \"csharp-module.dll\" / \"libcsharp-module.so\" / \"csharp-module.so\" (depending on operating system) from the modules folder. In the csharp-module is a function altMain defined, which starts the .NET runtime and registers itself as script runtime for csharp resources. That's the reason you have to specify type: csharp in the resource.cfg , so the altv-server knows that it should load this resource with the csharp-module. The custom .NET host tries to find the latest .NET SDK hostfxr.dll (example path on Windows is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\\host\\fxr\\5.0.1\\hostfxr.dll ). When it's found, it starts AltV.Net.Host.dll which is located next to the altv-server . Now in .NET world the AltV.Net.Host first initialize some delegates which can be triggered from the csharp-module . For example the csharp-module can trigger a delegate to start a specific resource with a name, path and a main file. The main initialization is now done and we are waiting until a resource of type csharp should be loaded. Summary: altv-server calls platform dependent csharp-module csharp-module acts as custom .NET host, starts .NET runtime with AltV.Net.Host.dll AltV.Net.Host initializes delegates which can be executed from csharp-module Loading a resource For every C# resource the csharp-module creates a CSharpResourceImpl . When the resource is started by the server, the class triggers AltV.Net.Host with the previous initialized ExecuteResource delegate. There a custom AssemblyLoadContext is created, which is responsible for loading and resolving assemblies like the resource and their dependencies. The load context loads the files just from the resource folder which it is created for and is isolated from other resources. In the end the resource assembly is loaded and the AltV.Net.dll assembly is initialized by calling the ModuleWrapper#MainWithAssembly among others. Here the main initialization happens: The entity factories are resolved which are needed for creating the entity pools. These entity pools are storing the active entities like for example currently connected players in the player pool. In order to receive events later from the server, it's required to set delegates which are executed on the csharp-module . This is done in CSharpResourceImpl from AltV.Net assembly. The functions which are executed are in ModuleWrapper and there the module functions are triggered. Depending if the resource derives from Resource or AsyncResource a different module is resolved. The AsyncModule is thereby derived from Module . The module is the main class which stores all entity pools, forwards events to IScript methods and the event handlers in resources, like Alt.OnPlayerEnterVehicle and so on. Afterwards the load context will be searched for implementations of IScript . These classes can have methods with custom attributes like ScriptEventAttribute . When specified for example ScriptEventType.PlayerConnect this method will be called every time a player connects. In order to get that working every IScript is loaded and the events registered. There are simply the Alt.On* events used (for non-async attributes). For PlayerConnect , there is an event handler for Alt.OnPlayerConnect which triggers the IScript method. Last but not least the csharp-module is now triggering the MainDelegate which is received in the ModuleWrapper . There it just execute the OnStart method of the resource. This OnStart has every resource implemented, as it is a abstract method on the Resource class. Summary: altv-server calls csharp-module to start resource csharp-module creates CSharpResourceImpl which triggers AltV.Net.Host AltV.Net.Host loads resource assembly and dependencies (with AltV.Net ) AltV.Net initializes itself and resource csharp-module triggers MainDelegate which executes resource OnStart Executing commands When executing a command like Alt.CreateVehicle the static Alt class is just a proxy for internal methods. In the end it will trigger most likely a method inside of AltNative . This is a partial class (multiple files which are combined to one class) and acts as thin wrapper for the csharp-module . In the vehicle example AltNative.Server_CreateVehicle is executed, which is a exported function in the csharp-module . The Alt.Net assembly uses the DllImportAttribute to call the method from the native library. Inside of the csharp-module the data is copied to internal data structures and then send to the altv-server . Receiving events The events are received in the csharp-module . Every resource receives most of the events in CSharpResourceImpl::OnEvent . This prepares the data and executes a method of the ModuleWrapper with a delegate previous set in the initialization. For example for the alt::CEvent::Type::PLAYER_ENTER_VEHICLE the required data is retrieved from the event and OnPlayerEnterVehicleDelegate is executed. This delegate is part of ModuleWrapper and there directly the OnPlayerEnterVehicle method of the loaded module is executed. From there the entites are checked if these are valid and exists on the server. In the end all registered event handler are executed, like Alt.OnPlayerEnterVehicle or ScriptEventAttribute .",

    "title": "Loop all fast and secure",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Loop all fast and secure This article will describe how to loop players, vehicles, ect. fast and secure. You first have to create a custom class that implements the callback interface. There are two callback interfaces to implement. IBaseObjectCallback is used for none async code. The loop execution also blocks the execution on the main thread. You should also not use async code within the callback (or at least lock usage of entities). IAsyncBaseObjectCallback which is for calling async code in it. The callback gets executed inside of an own task and therefore is awaitable. Use this callback class either when you have to execute asynchronous code inside the loop or when the loop call itself gets executed asynchronously (not in main thread). The entity object parameter by using this callback class is validated and it is safe to be used outside of the main thread without need of using lock statements. Remember that you have to inherit your resource class from AsyncResource (AltAsync package) instead of Resource , otherwise you don't have entity validation. Technically both callbacks, no mather the interface can be called in async code. IAsyncBaseObjectCallback will result in returning a Task and uses async safe entity references (like AsyncPlayerRef instead of PlayerRef when iterating over players). This example is for IPlayer's but can be used for IVehicle , IBlip , ICheckpoint , IColShape and IVoiceChannel as well. class MyPlayerCallback : IBaseObjectCallback<IPlayer> { public void OnBaseObject(IPlayer player) { // do something CheckPlayerPosition(player.Position); } } class MyPlayerSaveToDBCallback : IAsyncBaseObjectCallback<IPlayer> { public async Task OnBaseObject(IPlayer player) { // do something var dbPlayer = await LoadPlayerFromDb(player.Id); await SavePlayer(dbPlayer); } } Now you can create some class instances. var myPlayerCallback = new MyPlayerCallback(); var myPlayerSaveToDBCallback = new MyPlayerSaveToDbCallback(); Now you can trigger the OnBaseObject calls inside them. await Alt.ForEachPlayers(myPlayerSaveToDBCallback); Alt.ForEachPlayers(myPlayerCallback); As you can see the ForEachPlayers method returns a Task that is done when all OnBaseObject calls that return a Task are done as well. They are currently called sequently. Its allowed to reuse the created class instances for as many calls as you want. Exceptions inside a callback will result into the method to fail and forward the exception to the caller. Function / lambda callbacks Since writing multiple classes for each iteration purpose can be exhausting, you can also use these two generic callback implementations. With them you can use lambda expressions to define the loop code. Just keep in mind that using classes is better in performance than using lambda functions (which is probably negligible). public class FunctionCallback<T> : IBaseObjectCallback<T> where T : IBaseObject { private readonly Action<T> _callback; public FunctionCallback(Action<T> callback) { _callback = callback; } public void OnBaseObject(T baseObject) { _callback(baseObject); } } public class AsyncFunctionCallback<T> : IAsyncBaseObjectCallback<T> where T : IBaseObject { private readonly Func<T, Task> _callback; public AsyncFunctionCallback(Func<T, Task> callback) { _callback = callback; } public Task OnBaseObject(T baseObject) { return _callback(baseObject); } } Usage: var callback = new FunctionCallback<IPlayer>(player => { // do something CheckPlayerPosition(player.Position); }); Alt.ForEachPlayers(callback); var asyncCallback = new AsyncFunctionCallback<IPlayer>(async (player) => { // do something var dbPlayer = await LoadPlayerFromDb(player.Id); await SavePlayer(dbPlayer); }); Alt.ForEachPlayers(asyncCallback); If you need entity validation without having the need for using await statement you can do this: var asyncCallback = new AsyncFunctionCallback<IPlayer>(async (player) => { // do something Alt.Log(player.Name); await Task.CompletedTask; // you need at least one await statement in async methods }); Alt.ForEachPlayers(asyncCallback);",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Resource initialization order Why you should know the initialization order The Resource and AsyncResource classes provide overridable methods to modify the instantiation of players or vehicles and to modify the pools of those entities - just to name some. Now, one could need custom parameters while instantiating, for example, a new class inheriting from IPlayer , assuming that there exists a player factory ( MyPlayerFactory ) using a custom argument ( myConstant ) in the constructor, which is later on passed to the player class. public override IEntityFactory<IPlayer> GetPlayerFactory() { return new MyPlayerFactory(/* insert your value for myConstant */); } This could be an example, where a constructor argument is needed. Now, consider the case where your player - and thus your player factory - needs a constructor value which is also used by other components later on in the initialization process. Then you probably would like to know which initialization order the alt:V follows, to provide the correct instances and values to all of your components. For example, for the example above, you would have to create the value in the constructor and save it to a class variable like this: class MyResource : Resource { private string mySecret; public MyResource() { mySecret = \"1234\"; } public override IEntityFactory<IPlayer> GetPlayerFactory() { return new MyPlayerFactory(mySecret); } public override OnStart() { // we could need our secret also here new AnotherComponent(mySecret); } public override OnStop() {} } Initialization order The initialization order is as follows: 1. Resource constructor A resource in C# is created by either inheriting from Resource or AsyncResource on a class and provide overrides for OnStart() and OnStop() . The constructor of the class inheriting from Resource or AsyncResource is called first, which makes sense because the class of the resource has to be instantiated. 2. Entity factories and entity pool methods Second, the entity factory and entity pool methods are called, since before the resource starts, the internal module (of type Module ) has to know about all factories and pools as they can not be changed later on. 3. GetModule override After the creation of entity factories and entity pools, GetModule is called with all its arguments. 4. OnStart override Nothing much to say about it. The literal start of the resource is about to be begin. 5. Intermediate overrides and events All events known to the public API ( AltV.Net.Alt.On... ) and the method OnTick(...) are possible to be called multiple times between OnStart() and OnStop() , since events can occur multiple times and a tick occurs every few milliseconds. 6. OnStop override on resource stop OR graceful server shutdown The last step is the stop of the alt:V server. Keep in mind that OnStop is only called if the resource was stopped manually using the alt:V API or by gracefully stopping the alt:V server. Otherwise, this event will not be executed !",

OnWrite will call automatically when you put a object that is a instance of your class into Alt.Emit, player.Emit ect. This is a simple example of a class only containing a single int. public class MyClass : IWritable { private int myInt; public MyClass(int myInt) { this.myInt = myInt; } public void OnWrite(IMValueWriter writer) { writer.BeginObject(); // We tell the writer to create a object. writer.Name(\"myInt\"); // We tell the writer the next attribute of the object has the name 'myInt'. writer.Value(myInt); // We tell the writer the value for the attribute 'myInt'. writer.EndObject(); // We tell the writer that we are done creating the object. } } Now you can just send a instance of the class. player.Emit(\"myEventName\", new MyClass(42)); This will result in the following js output alt.onServer(\"myEventName\", (myClass) => { alt.log(JSON.stringify(myClass)); alt.log(myClass.myInt); // 42 }) // Console: { \"myInt\": 42 } Step 4 To send arrays its the same logic. public class MyClass2 : IWritable { public void OnWrite(IMValueWriter writer) { writer.BeginObject(); // We tell the writer to create a object. writer.Name(\"myInts\"); // We tell the writer the next attribute of the object has the name 'myInts'. writer.BeginArray(); // We tell the writer the value for the attribute 'myInts' is a array. for (int i = 0;i < 3;i++ { writer.BeginObject(); writer.Name(\"myInt\"); writer.Value(i); writer.EndObject(); } writer.EndArray(); // We tell the writer we are done creating the array writer.EndObject(); // We tell the writer that we are done creating the object. } } Now you can just send a instance of the class. player.Emit(\"myEventName\", new MyClass2()); This will result in the following js output alt.onServer(\"myEventName\", (myClass) => { alt.log(JSON.stringify(myClass)); alt.log(myClass.myInts.length); // 3 alt.log(myClass.myInts[0].myInt); // 0 alt.log(myClass.myInts[1].myInt); // 1 alt.log(myClass.myInts[2].myInt); // 2 for (const obj of myClass.myInts) { alt.log(obj.myInt); } }) // Console: { \"myInts\": [ { \"myInt\": 0 }, { \"myInt\": 1 }, { \"myInt\": 2 }, ] } Step 5 To send arrays without keys its the same logic. public class MyClass3 : IWritable { public void OnWrite(IMValueWriter writer) { writer.BeginObject(); // We tell the writer to create a object. writer.Name(\"myInts\"); // We tell the writer the next attribute of the object has the name 'myInts'. writer.BeginArray(); // We tell the writer the value for the attribute 'myInts' is a array. for (int i = 0;i < 3;i++ { writer.Value(i); // We add the value to the array 'myInts' } writer.EndArray(); // We tell the writer we are done creating the array writer.EndObject(); // We tell the writer that we are done creating the object. } } Now you can just send a instance of the class. player.Emit(\"myEventName\", new MyClass3()); This will result in the following js output alt.onServer(\"myEventName\", (myClass) => { alt.log(JSON.stringify(myClass)); alt.log(myClass.myInts.length); // 3 }) // Console: { \"myInts\":[0,1,2] }",

AltTrace The AltV.Net nuget package provides a api to gamemodes for recording trace files. You can only write one trace file at the same time. The following code is starting writing a trace file. AltTrace.Start(\"traceFileName\"); This code stops writing a trace file. AltTrace.Stop(); You can also register a callback to know the size of the trace file while its written. AltTrace.OnTraceFileSizeChange += size => { Console.WriteLine(\"Trace file size:\" + size + \" bytes.\"); }; The trace file will be written to altv server directory. The trace file can be opened via visual studio 2019 or perfview on windows. The easiest way to trigger starting and stopping a trace file recording is to register a server side command. Some sample snippet long currentTraceSize = 0; AltTrace.OnTraceFileSizeChange += size => { currentTraceSize = size; }; Alt.OnConsoleCommand += (name, args) => { switch (name) { case \"trace_start\": if (args.Length != 1) { Console.WriteLine(\"trace_start {name}\"); return; } AltTrace.Start(args[0]); break; case \"trace_stop\": AltTrace.Stop(); break; case \"trace_size\": Console.WriteLine(\"trace file size: \" + currentTraceSize + \" bytes\"); break; } };",

    "type": "article",
    "href": "gta/articles/ped/clothing.html",
    "title": "Clothing",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Clothing Starting with the alt:V 4.0 release, in addition to setting the clothes on the client side (native: setPedComponentVariation), it is also possible to set them on the server side (setClothes, setDlcClothes, setProp, setDlcProp). Caution The synchronization of client-side set clothing is valid until the first time a server-side setter is used. To realize the client-side preview of clothes it is recommended to clone the player's ped and display the clothes on this ped (either with natives or using alt.setPedClothes & setPedDlcClothes). Introduction The utilization of the server-side setters is divided into 2 variants: normal setters, which are used like the natives dlc setters, which are used differently, but are less prone to gta updates and new clothing resources Usage Tip setClothes JS C# setDlcClothes JS C# setProp JS C# setDlcProp JS C# Remark: hairs are also clothes and therefor set by the setClothes function. While the setClothes function is basically equivalent to the native setPedComponentVariation , the setDlcClothes function has a slightly different functionality. In addition to the parameters of the setClothes function, the setDlcClothes function requires a dlc and uses relative rather than absolute ids for the clothes. The biggest advantage of using the dlc setter is that if the ids of the clothing shift (due to a gta update or an additional clothing resource that changes the load order), the relative dlc ids are still preserved. An adjustment of the clothing is therefore not necessary and everything can be used as usual. Caution Internally setClothes uses clothes.bin, which contains a mapping of the ids to the appropriate gta dlcs. Because of this setClothes can not be used with own dlc resources, otherwise this can not be synced. To use own dlc resources setDlcClothes is mandatory. Let's take the t-shirt with the drawable id 133 as example: It can either be set via setClothes ( player.setClothes(11, 133, 0) ) or via setDlcClothes ( player.setDlcClothes(alt.hash(\"mp_m_executive_01\"), 11, 4, 0) ). If Rockstar were to append another piece of clothing to the first dlc pack, the setClothes function would point to a different piece of clothing than which was originally used. The setDlcClothes function, on the other hand, is not affected because the used dlc pack has not changed. The usage of setProp (equivalent to setPedPropIndex ) and setDlcProp is the same as the cloth functions. Troubleshooting \"clothes override data\" error in console If you combine the client-side and server-side functions to set clothes, sooner or later you will encounter the following error message: clothes gta data 00000000000000111111011110 clothes override data 00000000000000111111011010 In order to analyze this error message in detail, special attention must be paid to which of the components is causing the error, as this also gives clues to the particular location of the code where it is used. Component 25 24 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 GTA data 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 Override data 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 As the analysis of these lines shows, the clothing mismatch is located at the component with id 2, which corresponds to the hair. The next step to solve this problem would be to check in the code where the hair is set (e.g. hairdresser or character creation) and switch to the server-side setter there. Clothing tool dlcs not found If you use the alt:V clothing tool to create the resources, please note that the clothes collection name is not the same as the dlc name used by gta. The collection name must be appended with mp_m_ for male clothes and mp_f_ for female clothes. For example, if your collection name is myAddonClothes , the dlc names will be mp_m_myAddonClothes and mp_f_myAddonClothes .",

This is the name of your resource: example/ Here go the Client-side Files: example/client/ Here go the Server-side Files: example/server/ Here go the configuration & information: example/resource.cfg Configuring the resource.cfg When you create a resource.cfg, it should look like something similar to this: type: js, main: server/server.js, client-main: client/client.js, client-files: [ client/* ], deps: [ chat ] deps Allows you to require other resources, if they aren't found your resource will fail to load! You can access exported functions & more by adding the following in your code: import chat from 'chat'; main is the main server file. client-main is the first file loaded on Client-side for a player. client-files can usually just contain client/* which will load ALL files. Creating serverside code - server.js Creating Server-side Code - server.js We're going to add chat as a dependency to our resource. Then we're going to import 'alt' and 'chat'. import * as alt from 'alt-server'; import chat from 'chat'; console.log('==> Your Resource Has Loaded! Horray!'); // Called on Server-side alt.on('playerConnect', (player) => { // Logs to the console. alt.log(`==> ${player.name} has connected.`); // Displays message to all players. chat.broadcast(`==> ${player.name} has joined.`); // Sets the player's model. player.model = 'mp_m_freemode_01'; // Spawns the player at coordinates x, y, z, with a delay of 1000 Milliseconds. player.spawn(813, -279, 66, 1000); // Emit to the player passed, the event name, the argument to send. alt.emitClient(player, 'Server:Log', 'hello', 'world'); }); Congrats you've written your first serverside code! That logs to the console Broadcasts to the chat on player join Forces the player to have the freeroam model and spawns them Emits an event to clientside See the clientside section down below to see how to intercept the event on clientside. Creating clientside code - client.js We're going to import two essential alt:V dependencies: natives and alt import * as alt from 'alt-client'; import * as native from 'natives'; alt.log('Client-side has loaded!'); alt.onServer('Server:Log', (msg1, msg2) => { alt.log(`Message From Server: ${msg1}`); alt.log(`Message From Server: ${msg2}`); }); Final Words First of all - Congrats you've written your first clientside code that logs to the 'F8' console => Open the console to see it. Followed by setting up a whole server with basic fundamentals! Word of advice Keep in mind that... alt:V uses ES6 modules the server does not automatically update",

You should try using a prototype to set and give a player a weapon. alt.Player.prototype.setWeapon = function(weaponName) { this.currentWeapon = alt.hash(weaponName); this.currentWeaponName = weaponName; }; player.currentWeaponComponents Used to get all weapon components that are currently on a player's currently equipped weapon. All weapon components are hashed. const currentWeaponComponents = player.currentWeaponComponents; for (let i = 0; i < currentWeaponComponents.length; i++) { const weaponComponentHash = currentWeaponComponents[i]; } player.currentWeaponTintIndex Used to get the currently equipped weapon's tint index. const currentTint = player.currentWeaponTintIndex; player.dimension Used to get or set the player's current dimension. Dimensions are based on INT32. Which means there is a minimum and maximum value for a dimension. From -2147483648 to 2147483648 . A description for dimensions written by Heron is as follows. X can see only X -X can see 0 and -X 0 can't see -X and X The default dimension is 0 . const currentDimension = player.dimension; player.dimension = 1; // If you need a unique instance per player join. This is a decent way to handle it. // Just remember to set it back to zero after you do whatever you need to do in a unique dimension. player.dimension = player.id; player.entityAimOffset Used to get the player's current aim offset. There is currently not existing use case for this specific function. At the time of writing this document we're not even sure if it's functioning. player.entityAimingAt Used to get the player's current entity they are aiming at. The current sentiment is that this specific property does not work. At the time of writing this document we're not even sure if it's functioning. player.flashlightActive Used to get the player's flashlight activity? At the time of writing this document we're not even sure if it's functioning. player.health Used to get or set the player's current health. Health in GTA:V is based on the values 100 - 200 . 200 is the player's maximum health. < 100 means the player is dead. const currentHealth = player.health; player.health += 10; if (player.health > 200) { player.health = 200; } // Kill the player. player.health = 0; player.hwidExHash This is one of two ways to get a unique hardware hash that belongs to the player. This is a great way to ban a player; especially when they'll need a whole new set of hardware to get past your ban. Nobody currently knows the way this hardware information is determined. const currentHwidEx = player.hwidExHash; player.hwidHash This is one of two ways to get a unique hardware hash that belongs to the player. This is a great way to ban a player; especially when they'll need a whole new set of hardware to get past your ban. Nobody currently knows the way this hardware information is determined. const currentHwid = player.hwidHash; player.id Used to get the player's current id. These are strictly unique to the join order of a player. ID's may be used up to the value 65535 . After reaching 65,535 the id is recycled to a new joiner. alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect); function handleConnect(player) { alt.log(`${player.name} has joined with the ID of ${player.id}`); } player.ip In most cases this is an IP that is converted from IPv4 to IPv6. An example of what a local host IP looks like: ::ffff:127.0.0.1 alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect); function handleConnect(player) { if (player.ip === `::ffff:127.0.0.1`) { alt.log(`${player.name} has joined from local host.`); } } player.maxArmour Used to set or get the player's current maximum armour. The maximum value this can be set to is 65535 . After setting this you can set the player's current armour to the maximum armour value. const currentMaxArmour = player.maxArmour; if (currentMaxArmour <= 100) { player.maxArmour = 65535; player.armour = 65535; } alt.log(`${player.name} is a chunker.`); player.maxHealth Used to set or get the player's current maximum health. The maximum value this can be set to is 65535. After setting this you can set the player's current health to the maximum health value. const currentMaxHealth = player.maxHealth; if (currentMaxHealth <= 100) { player.maxHealth = 65535; player.health = 65535; } alt.log(`${player.name} is a healthy chunker.`); player.model Used to set set or get the player's current model. You may pass a string value here. No model is set automatically and should be set when the player is connected or authenticated. alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect); function handleConnect(player) { player.model = 'mp_m_freemode_01'; } player.name Used to get the player's current name. This is set by the player in their options. alt.on('playerConnect', handleConnect); function handleConnect(player) { if (player.name.toLowerCase() === 'stuyk') { player.kick(`Stupid name.`); } } player.netOwner Used to get the current network owner responsible for syncing an entity with the server. Inherited from entity. This is not necessarily a useful property for the average developer. const currentOwner = player.netOwner; if (!currentOwner) { console.log(`Looks like nobody owns this entity.`); } player.ping Used to get the player's current ping. Below is a snippet to make player ping accessible by all players. alt.setInterval(handlePingUpdate, 5000); function handlePingUpdate() { const currentPlayers = [...alt.Player.all]; for (let i = 0; i < currentPlayers.length; i++) { const player = currentPlayers[i]; if (!player || !player.valid) { continue; } player.setSyncedMeta('ping', player.ping); } } player.pos Used to get or set the player's current position. When getting the player's current position you should use a spread operator to make it modifiable. const currentPos = { ...player.pos }; currentPos.x += 1; // Teleport them under the map. player.pos = { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }; // Create a Vector3 with the alt function. player.pos = new alt.Vector3(0, 0, 0); player.rot Used to get or set the player's current rotation. However, setting rotation is broken on server-side . const currentRot = { ...player.rot }; player.seat Used to get the current seat that the player is in. if (player.vehicle && player.seat === -1) { alt.log(`Player is in the driver's seat.`); // Front Left } if (player.vehicle && player.seat === 0) { alt.log(`Player is riding shotgun.`); // Passenger. Right side. } if (player.vehicle && player.seat === 1) { alt.log(`Player is behind the driver's seat.`); // Back Left } if (player.vehicle && player.seat === 2) { alt.log(`Player is behind the player riding shotgun.`); // Back Right } player.socialId Used to get a non-safe version of a player's current social club identification that is linked to their Rockstar account. Keep in mind that this value IS NOT SAFE do not use it for authentication. IT CAN BE SPOOFED . const social = player.socialId; player.valid Used to get if a player entity is still valid. This is useful when using timeouts, intervals, and handling disconnect events. A player that invalid means that it can longer receive data from the server. alt.on('playerDisconnect', handleDisconnect); function handleDisconnect(player, reason) { if (!player || !player.valid) { console.log(`Looks like this player is already invalid. Can't save anything.`); return; } console.log(`${player.name} has disconnected.`); } player.vehicle Used to get the current vehicle that the player is inside. Returns null or undefined if the player is NOT in a vehicle. if (player.vehicle) { console.log(`Player is in a vehicle. Let's change its color!`); player.vehicle.setPrimaryColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 255 }; } if (!player.vehicle) { console.log(`Player is not in a vehicle.`); }",

Configuring the server.cfg Once you're done changing the stated things above, it's time to head to the server again. The server.cfg is where the magic happens, here you can change what is most important. Once opened, something similar to this should appear: name: 'alt:V Server' host: 0.0.0.0 port: 7788 players: 128 #password: ultra-password announce: false #token: YOUR_TOKEN gamemode: Freeroam website: example.com language: en description: 'alt:V Sample Server' modules: [ js-module ] resources: [ ] Using debug mode (server) While you are developing make sure you ENABLE the following inside the server.cfg. Add this to your config: debug: true Once enabled, you can now use several debug commands like: restart [RESOURCE] stop [RESOURCE] start [RESOURCE] reconnect * *Reconnect can cause bugs and issues, this is an experimental feature and only meant to be used in development. Adding resources Adding a resource is as simple as putting the folders name inside of the resources array. No commas necessary - But you can add them if you want. Right now, your resource array is empty. Keep in mind, as you've chosen the Example Resource Pack you've got three example resources. Load them, by simple adding the folder names* *The name is case sensitive! - Also templating with [resourceName] isn't gonna work as seen in other multiplayer modifications. resources: [ freeroam chat newResource ]",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Setup VSCode for your project In this article we'll focus on configuration and creation of simple node built-in scripts. Warning This article is still a work in progress. Downloading VSCode Before we start, we need downloaded and installed software, so in case you didn't download yet, here you can find all download types for different platforms. By the time I'm writing this article, I'm using Windows portable package. Choose language and model Now, you're left with decision to go with JavaScript or TypeScript. I'll cover configuration for both of them, but if you don't know which one to choose and you're ok with familiarising yourself with additional features that TypeScript implements, you should definitely choose it. Also it'd be good to know if you're creating project for client-side/server-side model or both (will be mentioned later). Preparing folder for project In VSCode click File -> Open Folder, this option will open File Dialog. Create folder in your preferred directory and select folder which you've just created. All project files will be stored in that folder. Caution Always open your project as folder instead of single files. Creating node package Now we'll cover using Terminal feature for executing shell scripts in your project folder. To open it, click View -> Terminal, which will show docked window at the bottom of the editor. Terminal will use default shell in your system (for Windows 10 it's PowerShell). Any possible differences in my shell scripts will be mentioned. Now execute this script in Terminal npm init --yes It will create default package configuration file without asking any questions. You can fill them up later. Now you can install types definitions for your chosen model, which will be used by editor for code validation, auto-completion etc. Check out this document for up-to-date information. If you've chosen TypeScript language for your project, you also need to install TypeScript package npm i -D typescript Creating configuration If you've chosen JavaScript project, your configuration file should be named jsconfig.json and for TypeScript project tsconfig.json . Both are similiar, so if you change your mind later, it won't be hard to switch later. Your configuration file should have content as below { \"compilerOptions\": { \"module\": \"es2015\", \"target\": \"es6\", \"checkJs\": true, \"strict\": true, \"typeRoots\": [ \"./node_modules/@types\", \"./node_modules/@altv\" ], \"outDir\": \"out\" }, \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"] } Tip Notice typeRoots entry, it's necessary for alt:V types to work without manually defining every package. If you desire to minimise used packages to minimum, use types entry instead. First project script Now we can create our first script, which should be named index.js (as described in package.json ). To test if it all works properly, you can copy this code below import * as alt from \"alt-client\"; alt.setInterval(() => { alt.log(\"This is a self repeating notification every 5 seconds.\"); }, 5000); Warning If you're creating server-side script, you may get error mentioning that module alt-client cannot be found. In this case just change it to alt-server . If all went well, you shouldn't get any errors in your script as well as when typing alt. you should get auto-completion for all available types in that module. Creating resource configuration For this project to be recognised by a language module, we need to create resource configuration file. You can check here for how to proceed.",

The custom resource class will be created for every resource that uses your module type. Table of Conents What is a resource How to create your own resource class Event handling What is a resource A resource is created for every resource loaded by the alt:V core. Every resource has some data attached to it like the resource name, the resource path, etc. The module is in charge of handling the start, stop, event, tick etc. events of every resource. How to create your own resource class To create our own resource class, we need to extend from the alt::IResource::Impl interface, and implement its methods. The interface has the following methods that can be implemented: Method Description MakeClient Reserved for assetpack resources, currently this has no use Start Called when the resource is started Stop Called when the resource is stopped OnEvent Called every time an event has been fired OnTick Called every tick OnCreateBaseObject Called every time a base object has been created OnRemoveBaseObject Called every time a base object has been removed Remember that resources can be started and stopped at runtime, so you should do a proper cleanup in the Stop method. And because of that you also should not start any resource logic in the constructor, use the Start method instead. Your custom resource class should look something like this: class MyResource : public alt::IResource::Impl { // Save the runtime on our resource so we have direct access to it MyRuntime* runtime; // It is important to save the actual 'alt::Resource' class instance somewhere, // it's used for stuff like getting the resource name, resource path etc. // We receive this instance when the resource is created and we can pass it from the runtime // to our resource and save it here alt::IResource* resource; public: // This is the same constructor used as in the previous article about script runtimes MyResource(MyRuntime* runtime, alt::IResource* resource) : runtime(runtime), resource(resource) { // Don't start any logic in the constructor! // Start the resource in the 'Start' method } // Returns a boolean indicating whether the resource could be successfully loaded bool Start() { // Start some resource specific logic here e.g. instantiating a new context for the script of the resource return true; } // Returns a boolean indicating whether the resource could be successfully stopped bool Stop() { // Stop the resource specific logic e.g. destroying the context of the script of the resource return true; } // Returns a bool whether other resources should receive this event bool OnEvent(const alt::CEvent* ev) { // Proper event handling will be explained in another article return true; } void OnTick() { // This can be used to clean up stuff in chunks etc. to save performance // Also useful for handling timers } void OnCreateBaseObject(alt::Ref<alt::IBaseObject> object) { // Here you can e.g. add the base object to some list for validating if a base object still exists } void OnRemoveBaseObject(alt::Ref<alt::IBaseObject> object) { // Here you can e.g. remove the base object from some aforementioned list } } Your actual resource class will be much larger, you should use the class to store any resource specific data. Event Handling Now that your module has a working script runtime and a working resource class, it is now already possible to create resources that use your module type. In the next article you will learn how to properly handle events, received with the OnEvent method.",

(This class can be found in IScriptRuntime.h ) This interface has two methods that need to be implemented by your own class: Method Description CreateImpl Creates a new resource for your module and returns it DestroyImpl Destroys an existing resource for your module There are also a few other methods that can be overriden, but it is not neccessary to do so: Method Description OnTick Called every tick (on serverside every 50ms) OnDispose Called when the script runtime gets destroyed (server shutdown) RequiresMain Returns whether your module requires main to be present in the resource.cfg You also need to implement a constructor for you class. Your script runtime class should look something like this: // Create our own script runtime class class MyRuntime : public alt::IScriptRuntime { static MyRuntime* instance = nullptr; public: MyRuntime() { // Save the instance on the static property instance = this; // Here we should instantiate the runtime for our scripting language etc. } alt::IResource::Impl* CreateImpl(alt::IResource* resource) override { // Create a new heap allocated instance of our resource class and return it return new MyResource(this, resource); } void DestroyImpl(alt::IResource::Impl* impl) override { // Cast the received resource to our own resource class MyResource* resource = dynamic_cast<MyResource*>(impl); // Delete the resource if(resource != nullptr) delete resource; } // Create a static method on our class to retrieve the instance of the runtime static MyRuntime* GetInstance() { return instance; } } Typically, your own class will be much larger, you should use this class to store and handle everything related to the module. Creating your own resource This was it for now regarding the script runtime. Next, you should create your own class for resources. You will learn about this in the next article .",

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc First Steps for your own module It is now time to start using the SDK to create your own module, this article will teach you the first steps to creating and running your module. Table of Contents Setup Creating the entry file Needed module exports Creating your own runtime Setup Firstly, you should create your C++ project. What compiler, IDE, etc. you use is completely up to you, as long as it outputs a 64-bit DLL it's good to go. Make sure to correctly set the include path so you can import the SDK header files from your project. Also make sure your compiler is configured to support C++17 features, otherwise using the SDK will not work. Next, add the ALT_SERVER_API or ALT_CLIENT_API define to your compiler or in the main header file of your code, this enables specific features in the SDK. Your main header file should now look something like this: #define ALT_SERVER_API #include \"cpp-sdk/SDK.h\" This is the bare minimum needed setup for your module. Creating the entry file Now you need to create your first .cpp file, where your entry point function will be. The entry point function is called by the alt:V core when your module is loaded, from that entry point function you need to start your module. On serverside, the needed entry function is called altMain and it returns a bool whether the module could be started or it failed. This function receives the alt:V core instance as the first argument, you need to set the received instance as the used instance for the SDK. You also need to register your runtime as a script runtime in this function. The altMain function should then look something like this: // The 'EXPORT' macro is defined by the SDK // It is needed so the alt:V core can call this function EXPORT bool altMain(alt::ICore* core) { // Important! Sets the core for the SDK to the received instance, so you can interact with the server or client alt::ICore::SetInstance(core); // Pseudocode of creating a runtime, // how to create your own runtime will be explained in another article auto runtime = new MyRuntime(); // Register the script runtime // The first argument is the 'type' for your module, // that needs to be specified in the resource.cfg // The second argument is a pointer to your runtime instance core->RegisterScriptRuntime(\"myModule\", runtime); // Logs an info message to the console core->LogInfo(\"Loaded my module!\"); // Return true to indicate that the module loaded successfully return true; } On clientside it works a little differently, you need to export an entry point function called CreateScriptRuntime that returns a pointer to an instance of your runtime. Like on serverside, it receives the alt:V core as the first argument, you also need to set the core instance on the clientside. The CreateScriptRuntime function should look something like this: EXPORT alt::IScriptRuntime* CreateScriptRuntime(alt::ICore* core) { // Important! Sets the core for the SDK to the received instance, so you can interact with the server or client alt::ICore::SetInstance(core); // Pseudocode of creating a runtime, // how to create your own runtime will be explained in another article auto runtime = new MyRuntime(); // Return the pointer to our runtime // If it fails, return nullptr return runtime; } The alt::ICore is the main interface for interacting with the server or client, it provides the necessary functions like getting all entities, creating a vehicle etc. You should only ever create a single instance of your runtime in the entry point function, the function will only be called once when the server or client starts and is the only place where you should create create an instance of your runtime. Needed module exports The module doesn't only need the entrypoint function as an export, on both sides there is also another export needed. You need to export the GetSDKVersion function, which returns the version of the SDK the module was compiled with. This is needed so the alt:V core can check if the used module SDK version is compatible with the alt:V core SDK version. You just need to return alt::ICore::SDK_VERSION from this function. The function should look like this: EXPORT uint32_t GetSDKVersion() { return alt::ICore::SDK_VERSION; } Remember that your module always needs to be on the same SDK version as the SDK version used by the alt:V core. Otherwise, your module will not load. On clientside, you also need another export called GetType that defines what the type of the module is. That is the client-type that needs to be specified in the resource.cfg for your module to be used for the resource. This function should return a const char* of the module type. It should look like this: EXPORT const char* GetType() { return \"myModule\"; } Now you finished the first steps to creating your own module. The needed exports are set up, and now you are ready to create your own script runtime. Creating your own runtime In the next article, you will learn how to create your own script runtime .",

    "title": "Handling events",
    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Handling events In this article you will learn how to handle and emit events with the module SDK. Table of Contents What is an event How to handle events Handling events globally Handling events per resource Canceling events How to emit events What are MValues What is an event An event is an action that has happened on the client/server and is not caused by the developer directly. E.g. when a player is spawned no event is dispatched, because the developer has full control over spawning the player, and because of that no event is needed. On the other hand when e.g. a player gets damaged, the player damage event gets dispatched, so the developer can act upon that action. Events are automatically dispatched by the alt:V core and need to be handled and forwarded to the scripting language by the module. How to handle events There are two ways to handle events. They can be either handled globally, or they are handled by each resource individually. It is recommended the module handles the events per resource. Both approaches will be covered here. Handling events globally Events can be handled globally by using the alt::ICore::SubscribeEvent method. This method accepts three parameters, first is the event type that should be handled, second is the callback for the event and third is the custom user data passed to the callback. The user data is optional and can be left as a nullptr . Here is an example on how to handle the player connect event globally: alt::ICore::Instance().SubscribeEvent(alt::CEvent::Type::PLAYER_CONNECT, [](const alt::CEvent* ev, void* userData) { // Cast the event to the correct event class to access the event data auto event = static_cast<const alt::CPlayerConnectEvent*>(ev); // Gets the player that connected to the server alt::Ref<alt::IPlayer*> player = event->GetTarget(); // Gets the connect reason alt::StringView reason = event->GetReason(); // Log the player name and connect reason to the console std::stringstream stream; stream << \"Player \" << player->GetName().CStr() << \" connected. Reason: \" << reason.CStr(); alt::ICore::Instance().LogInfo(stream.str()); // In a real module we would obviously do something more useful with the data from this event, // like forwarding it to the scripting language. return true; }); This method can also catch all incoming events by using the alt::CEvent::Type::ALL event type. It is recommended to handle events per resource, handling events globally should mostly be used for debugging purposes. Handling events per resource The module can also choose to handle events per resource individually instead of in a single global event handler. This can be done by using the OnEvent method of your own resource class . When using this approach, you have to use the GetType method of the received event, to determine the type of the event and to cast it to its corresponding event class. An example for this can be seen here: bool MyResource::OnEvent(const alt::CEvent* ev) { // Get the type of the event auto type = ev->GetType(); // Do something if the event is the player connect event if(type == alt::CEvent::Type::PLAYER_CONNECT) { // Cast the event to the correct event class to access the event data auto event = static_cast<const alt::CPlayerConnectEvent*>(ev); // Gets the player that connected to the server alt::Ref<alt::IPlayer*> player = event->GetTarget(); // Gets the connect reason alt::StringView reason = event->GetReason(); // Log the player name and connect reason to the console std::stringstream stream; stream << \"Player \" << player->GetName().CStr() << \" connected. Reason: \" << reason.CStr(); alt::ICore::Instance().LogInfo(stream.str()); // In a real module we would obviously do something more useful with the data from this event, // like forwarding it to the scripting language. } } It is recommended to not handle every event in this method directly for clarity. There should be some sort of wrapper for events in your module. An example for this can be found in the JS module or the AngelScript module . A list of event types can be found here . Canceling events There are two ways of cancelling an event, either you can cancel an event to discard it's data to not sync it to other clients except than the player who sent that data (E.g. in the explosion event), or you cancel an event to remove it from the event queue so that other event handlers (global or per resource) will not receive that event. The first way can be achieved by calling the Cancel method on the received event, and the second way can be done by returning false from the event callback. How to emit events It is possible to emit custom events ( alt::CEvent::Type::SERVER_SCRIPT_EVENT or alt::CEvent::Type::CLIENT_SCRIPT_EVENT ) from the module. These events can be emitted by using alt::ICore::TriggerLocalEvent , alt::ICore::TriggerServerEvent and alt::ICore::TriggerClientEvent respectively. These methods take the custom event name and the event arguments as parameters. The event arguments have to be in the form of MValues . An example on how to emit an custom event can be found here: // Create an instance of an MValueArgs array to store our event arguments. // We can also use an `alt::Array<alt::MValueConst>` instead, they are the same. // But we use MValueArgs here for code clarity. alt::MValueArgs args; // Push an integer to the arguments auto arg = alt::ICore::Instance().CreateMValueInt(523); args.Push(arg); // Push a bool to the arguments auto arg2 = alt::ICore::Instance().CreateMValueBool(true); args.Push(arg2); // Emit the event alt::ICore::Instance().TriggerLocalEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", args); All methods to create MValues can be found here .

This guide will teach you the basics on how to write your own alt:V scripting module and will explain important concepts and other good-to-know things for the SDK. Table of Contents Requirements What is the Module SDK How to use the Module SDK How to use the Module SDK from C or languages that support C code The next steps Requirements There are several requirements for this guide, and if you do not fulfill all of them, the guide will be hard to understand and impossible to follow. Listed here are the requirements for working through this guide: Basic Knowledge of C++ or C Basic Knowledge of Git A text editor or IDE If you fulfill all of these requirements you are ready to go to the next section, if not you should not continue. What is the Module SDK The Module SDK is the primary SDK for you to create your module with and interact with the alt:V server or client. With it, you can write a scripting module to add a new scripting language to alt:V. The SDK is available as a header-only library for you to include in your project, the actual code for the SDK lies in the alt:V core and as such is not open source. So it is very easy to use the SDK, as you only need to include the needed headers in your project and the classes and methods inside the headers can then be used, once your module is injected into the client or server. It is possible to both write a server and a client module. Many things are exactly the same on both sides, but for specific features see the client and server directories. Because the API is mainly the same, much of your code can be reused so it is possible to write your module in a single project that works for both the server- and the clientside. To create a module that can be used on both sides, the defines ALT_SERVER_API and ALT_CLIENT_API can be used to check which side the module is currently being run on. How to use the Module SDK As stated in the last section, including the Module SDK in your project is very easy as the SDK only consists of header files. To add the SDK to your project simply clone the repository and add it as a submodule to your own project. The next step is to include the header files in your project somewhere. You can include the SDK.h to include all the header files of the SDK. #include <cpp-sdk/SDK.h> That's it! Now you can use the classes and methods provided by the SDK. Don't forget to include this header in a common header file of your project, or include it in every file individually. Of course you can also just only include the header files that you currently need. It is important that you build your module with the /MT flag and use release mode, otherwise your module will have undefined behaviour. How to use the Module SDK from C or languages that support C code If you want to use the Module SDK but can not or don't want to use C++, but instead want to use C or any other language that supports C code (or C FFI) to write your module, then you can use the C Bindings Generator by Hazard. The wrapper autogenerates C bindings for the C++ SDK and provides the ability to use the SDK from any language that supports C FFI. The guide will assume that the SDK is used from C++ directly, when the C Wrapper is used there will be some changes needed, but the general concepts stay the same. The next steps Now that you are familiar with how to include the SDK in your project, you can now begin using it and creating your module. The next article will tell you the first steps of creating your own module .",

Table of Contents What are MValues The different MValue types How to create MValues Refs What are MValues MValues are containers that store a value of some specific data type. They are created so that a value can be exchanged between different programming languages without much hassle. There is an MValue Type for every different data type one would need to exchange between resource and/or client and server. For example there is an MValue for Integers , the MValue stores the C++ integer and then the MValue can be passed to e.g. an event. The module then has to convert the C++ value stored in the MValue to the corresponding value in the programming language the module offers. The different MValue types In total there are 13 different MValue types, each of these types is used to store some other type of data. Here is a list of all different MValue types: Type Description None An implicit empty value, used for invalid values Nil An explicit empty value, used for null in most languages Bool A boolean value ( true / false ) Int A whole number, can be either positive or negative UInt A whole number, can only be positive Double A floating point number String A text value List A collection of multiple elements (aka. array ) Dict A dictionary with key-value pairs BaseObject An alt:V base object (Objects like vehicles, players etc.) Function A function that can be called Vector2 A two-dimensional vector Vector3 A three-dimensional vector RGBA A R(ed), G(reen), B(lue), A(lpha) color ByteArray An array of raw bytes To verify all MValue types available see the SDK source code . All MValue number types are 64-bit and floating-point numbers are doubles How to create MValues The module can create MValues by using the methods provided by alt::ICore . There is at least one method for every different MValue type, which returns that MValue type. A small example on how to create an MValue and get the data stored in it can be found here: // Create the MValue by using the method from the core alt::MValueInt mvalue = alt::ICore::Instance().CreateMValueInt(4324); // Get the data stored in the MValue // All MValue types have a 'Value' method that returns it's stored method int64_t value = mvalue.Value(); // You can also check the type of the MValue if its a generic MValue alt::IMValue::Type type = mvalue.GetType(); if(type == alt::IMValue::Type::INT) { // Now the MValue can be casted to the correct MValue class auto castedMvalue = static_cast<alt::MValueInt>(mvalue); } Another example can be found in the article about event handling .

    "keywords": "Improve this Doc Refs This article will explain what Refs are and how to use them. Table of Contents What are Refs How to use Refs What are Refs If you are familiar with modern C++ you probably know what smart pointers are, and how to use them. A Ref is similiar to the popular shared_ptr container from the standard library. It stores a heap-allocated object and controls its lifetime and memory by using refcounting. If there are no more instances of the Ref exist, the stored object will be freed automatically. They are however different, as the shared_ptr stores the refcount on the shared_ptr container, while the Ref in the SDK stores the refcount on the stored object inside the Ref . That is also why any object stored in a Ref must inherit from alt::CRefCountable . How to use Refs To create a Ref you can simply use the Ref class. Once you create a ref with the pointer of your object you want to store, make sure to NOT delete that pointer manually, the Ref is now responsible for managing the memory and lifetime of that object. The Ref class uses a template argument to specify which type of object is stored inside of it. The object stored inside the Ref can be accessed by using the Get() method. In most cases this is not necessary though, as the -> operator of the Ref is overloaded to access methods and properties of the object inside it without having to call Get() . A simple example of how to use a Ref : // To store our class in a Ref, // we need to inherit from 'alt::CRefCountable' class MyClass : public alt::CRefCountable { int id; public: MyClass(int _id) : id(_id) {} int GetID() { return id; } }; // We create a ref storing the instance of our class // The ref now takes care of managing the object's memory // Once the ref and each of its copies has been destroyed, // the memory for the object stored will be freed. alt::Ref<MyClass> myRef(new MyClass(1)); // We receive a new copy of the ref here, // so the ref count will be increased by 1, // and the object can not be freed, // as long as this copy exists. int GetRefId(alt::Ref<MyClass> ref) { // We use the overloaded '->' operator, // to access the method on the stored object directly, // without needing to call 'Get()' return ref->GetID(); } // We call this function that takes our ref and copies it, // and then calls a method on it int id = GetRefId(myRef); The SDK uses Refs in many places where instances of objects are passed, usually you do not need to worry about the refcounting of the Ref etc. You can safely store a copy of the Ref in your own std::vector or similiar, without having to think about the lifetime of the object. To see all available methods on Refs , refer to the header file in the SDK .",
